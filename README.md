Irodori Table does not upload telemetry or crash reports. It connects only to
endpoints selected or configured by the user and to documented project
endpoints needed for requested features, such as extension downloads and
release update checks. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for local crash-report
handling and security scope.

## Develop

### 5-Minute Quickstart

1. Get a toolchain. On Linux with Nix, the repository ships a dev shell that
   pins everything `task doctor` checks — the exact Rust from
   `rust-toolchain.toml`, Node 24, mold, and the WebKitGTK/GTK libraries:

   ```sh
   nix develop        # or `direnv allow` to enter it automatically
   ```

   Inside that shell, start the app with `task run-dev` rather than
   `task desktop-dev`. WebKit from the Nix store cannot use a non-NixOS host's
   GL drivers and aborts before a window appears; `run-dev` wraps the launch in
   nixGL to supply matching ones. Set `IRODORI_NO_NIXGL=1` to opt out.

   Without Nix, install the platform prerequisites for your OS:
   [Windows](https://irodori-table.github.io/irodori-docs/windows-development.html),
   [macOS](https://irodori-table.github.io/irodori-docs/macos-development.html), or
   [Linux](https://irodori-table.github.io/irodori-docs/linux-development.html).
   Linux users should install the WebKitGTK and linker packages from that guide
   before running the desktop app. `mold` in particular is required:
   `.cargo/config.toml` links through it, and without it every link fails.
2. From the repository root, install dependencies and check the local setup:

   ```sh
   task setup
   task doctor
   ```

3. Start the desktop development shell:

   ```sh
   task desktop-dev
   ```

`task desktop-dev` starts the Tauri shell and Vite dev server. Run `make help`
for the full list of root commands.
