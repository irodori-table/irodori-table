# Changelog

All notable changes to Irodori Table are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(pre-1.0: minor versions may include breaking changes).

## Release Policy

- Patch releases contain compatible fixes only. Security fixes should ship on the
  lowest active patch line that can receive them safely.
- Until 1.0, minor releases may include breaking changes, but each breaking
  change must be called out in this changelog with impact and migration notes.
- Major releases are reserved for intentional compatibility resets after 1.0.
- The stable auto-update channel follows published, non-prerelease GitHub
  Releases for `v*` tags.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Opening a table from the tree runs a statement the engine accepts.** The
  preview was always `select * from <schema>.<name> limit 200`, but the schema
  a non-SQL connector reports labels the tree rather than naming a namespace —
  DynamoDB's region, Redis's `db0`, a bare `default` — and several of these
  engines do not speak SQL at all. Double-clicking a DynamoDB table produced
  `select * from "us-east-1"."bookchecker-app" limit 200;`, wrong twice over:
  the region cannot be addressed, and PartiQL has no LIMIT clause (the row cap
  travels with the request). It now previews DynamoDB through PartiQL, ArangoDB
  through AQL, a Qdrant collection by naming it, and a Redis key with the
  command its type answers — `GET`, `LRANGE`, `HGETALL`, `SMEMBERS`, `ZRANGE`,
  `XRANGE`. Each form was run against a live server.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-08-24

A same-day fix for a 0.10.0 regression that stopped every password-bearing
extension connection from connecting.

### Fixed

- **Extension connections with a password connect again.** 0.10.0 took the
  foundation crates' new rule that a legacy plaintext `password` may not be
  serialized — a rule about *storing* a profile — and applied it, unintended,
  to the connector wire, where every connector reads its credential from
  exactly that field. The result was that every password-bearing extension
  connection failed at connect with `failed to encode connector profile:
  legacy plaintext password must be migrated to auth before serialization`:
  ArangoDB, ClickHouse, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Oracle, SQL Server and the
  rest. Built-in PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite connections were unaffected,
  which is why the integration suite stayed green. The password now travels
  with the connect request as it always did.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-24

Foundation uplift: the app now consumes irodori-kit v0.9.0, whose connection
profiles carry typed authentication and TLS models (profile schema v2). Nothing
changes for a saved connection — the app reads the new fields but does not yet
write them, and every existing profile keeps working untouched — so this is
capability arriving at the boundary rather than behavior changing underneath
it.

### Added

- **Connection profiles accept typed `auth` and `tls` blocks.** `auth` covers
  eleven kinds beyond none — password, token, API key, key-pair JWT, client
  certificate, Kerberos, OAuth2 (four flows), external browser, and AWS, GCP
  and Azure credential sources with their own typed variants (SSO, web
  identity, assume-role, ADC, impersonation, workload identity, managed
  identity, service principal, …). `tls` carries a mode — `disable`, `prefer`,
  `require`, `verifyCa`, `verifyFull`, `clientCertificate` — plus root and
  client certificate handles and a server name. Both fields are optional and
  default to today's behavior: `tls.mode: default` defers to the transport's
  existing TLS flag, so a profile that says nothing connects exactly as before.
  Credentials in these blocks are secure-store handles, never plaintext.
- The desktop TypeScript boundary exports the matching types (`AuthConfig`,
  `TlsConfig`, `TlsMode`, `JwtAlgorithm`, `OAuth2Flow`, `AwsAuthSource`,
  `GcpAuthSource`, `AzureAuthSource`).

### Fixed

- **A connector that writes a table's key as objects no longer empties the
  database tree.** Connector metadata asks for a key column as a name; the
  DynamoDB connector writes `{"name": "PK", "keyType": "HASH"}` for every
  key-schema entry, since that is what DynamoDB itself returns. The whole
  metadata document was rejected over the mismatch, so every table vanished
  behind "Could not load metadata" — with nothing on screen naming the field,
  and the connection itself connected and healthy. Both spellings are read now,
  index key schemas included, and an entry that names nothing is dropped
  instead of costing the user every table. *(Reproduced against DynamoDB Local:
  one table, connected fine, zero objects before; the table and its `PK`/`SK`
  key after.)*

### Changed

- **The titlebar's sidebar toggles are icons again, not framed buttons.** The
  open state painted a filled, bordered box with an accent edge around a glyph
  that already says the same thing — its panel side fills when that sidebar is
  open. The frame is gone; the open toggle is told apart by the color of the
  icon, and hover is the only painted state, as in VS Code.
- Consumed irodori-kit v0.9.0 (from v0.8.0) across connection, security, proxy,
  secure-store, completion, and generate. Proxy transport planning now honors
  profile TLS, and connection secret slots map onto purpose-bound secure-store
  handles.
- The foundation profile type treats a legacy plaintext `password` as
  deserialize-only: it is still read, but serializing one back out is now an
  error rather than a silent re-write of the credential. The desktop app passes
  profiles into Rust and never serializes them back, so saved connections are
  unaffected.
- SSH private-key auth is written as `privateKey` rather than `private_key` on
  the Rust/TypeScript boundary. `private_key` is still accepted when reading, so
  existing stored transports load unchanged.
- The connector ABI also recognizes `apiKey` and `accessToken` as wrapped scalar
  values, alongside `value`, `secret`, `token`, and `password`.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-08-24

Follow-up fixes for 0.9.0, plus dependency maintenance. Connectors installed
before the ABI probe existed get their declared connection model back without a
reinstall, and the new per-connection tabs stop carrying first-run buffers and
their tab numbering into every connection.

### Fixed

- **Connector connection models are backfilled for extensions already
  installed.** The model — auth methods, TLS controls, endpoint and profile
  fields — was captured from the connector's ABI probe at install time only, so
  every connector installed before that existed carried none. The connection
  form then fell back to the built-in host/port/user/password shape and the
  declared authentication methods were unreachable, with nothing on screen to
  say why: the form looked exactly as though the connector had declared
  nothing. Reinstalling was the only cure, and no reason to suspect one was
  ever shown. The installed libraries are now probed once on the next launch.
  *(Measured on a 37-connector install: 0 models before, 35 after — the two
  without are declarative extensions, which have no library to ask.)*
- **A new tab is numbered `query-1.sql` again.** The counter was
  `tabs.length + 1`, and `tabs` keeps closed tabs so **Reopen closed tab** can
  restore them — the three onboarding buffers included. The first new tab in an
  untouched group was therefore called `query-4.sql`, and every tab closed
  beforehand pushed the number further out. It now takes the lowest free
  `query-N` in the group.
- **A connection opened for the first time starts on one empty tab** instead of
  the three onboarding buffers (scratch, audit window, explain plan). Those
  belong to first run; repeating them for every connection was a side effect of
  giving each one its own tabs.

### Changed

- Updated the desktop npm tooling and editor group, including CodeMirror
  commands 6.11.0 and view 6.43.9, Dockview 8.2.0, Mermaid 11.17.0,
  lucide-react 1.33.0, Vite 8.2.2, oxfmt 0.64.0, and oxlint 1.79.0 (#246).
- Updated the Rust group: redis 1.6.0, and a single windows-sys 0.61.2 across
  the dependency tree in place of the four versions it had drifted into (#247).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-23

Transport security, a workbench that knows which connection you are on, and a
smaller product. Every PostgreSQL and MySQL connection the app made was
unencrypted; this release makes TLS possible, configurable, and verified. Tabs
now belong to a connection instead of floating above all of them. It also moves
the lakehouse line out of the app entirely, and fixes several places where the
workbench refused an action the user plainly meant.

> **If you installed from the Releases page, you have been on v0.8.5.** Every
> release since was published to the pre-release channel, and `Latest` — what
> the Releases page, `gh release download` with no tag, and installers such as
> `soar` all resolve — stayed on v0.8.5: the build from #214 that aborts with
> `EGL_BAD_PARAMETER` before a window appears on any Mesa/Wayland host. The fix
> shipped in v0.8.6 and reached nobody. This is the first stable release since,
> and `task release-latest-check` now fails when the stable channel falls that
> far behind again.

### Security

- **sqlx was compiled without TLS support.** `default-features = false` with no
  TLS feature meant there was nothing to negotiate with, so `sslmode=prefer` did
  not opportunistically encrypt and occasionally fall back — it never encrypted
  at all, and a hand-written `sslmode=require` failed to connect rather than
  connecting securely. Now built with `tls-rustls-ring-native-roots`: rustls to
  match the rest of the app, and the OS trust store, because a desktop client is
  routinely pointed at a server whose certificate chains to a CA the
  organisation installed.

### Added

- SSL controls on the connection form for every sqlx-backed engine — SSL mode,
  root certificate, client certificate, and client key. The app speaks the
  PostgreSQL vocabulary (`disable` … `verify-full`) and translates for MySQL,
  which has no `allow` and spells its strongest mode `verify_identity`.
- **Supabase** as a first-class engine. TLS required by default; the Supavisor
  transaction pooler is recognised from its port and prepared statements
  disabled automatically, which otherwise fails the *second* query on a
  connection with `prepared statement "sqlx_s_1" already exists`. The
  `postgres.<project-ref>` username shape is signposted in the form.
- Connector extensions' declared `connection` model is retained on install
  instead of being parsed for one assertion and discarded, so the connection
  form can eventually be rendered from what a connector declares.
- **The last SQL tab can be closed.** It used to be refused with a notice
  explaining that it stays open "so Ctrl+W never closes the browser tab" — a
  browser's reason, in a desktop app. The group shows a placeholder instead,
  and the tab's text is kept, so **Reopen closed tab** brings the SQL back.
- **Right-clicking a connection in the rail** offers Edit and Close.
- **Keyword completion on every engine, with no AI configured.** Typing `sel`
  on a DynamoDB connection previously offered nothing at all — true on 21 of
  the 47 engines, because the shared SQL keywords were gated on the list that
  decides which engines get SQL *snippets*, and those engines had no dialect
  terms of their own to fall back to. DynamoDB now completes PartiQL, Cassandra
  and ScyllaDB CQL, Neo4j and Memgraph Cypher, ArangoDB AQL, Couchbase SQL++,
  InfluxQL, IoTDB-SQL, and the command vocabularies for MongoDB, Redis and the
  vector stores. Non-SQL stores still get their own terms only.
- **Tabs belong to a connection.** They used to be global — one group pair
  shared by every profile — so switching connection left the same SQL on screen
  aimed at a different database, with nothing to say anything had moved. Each
  connection now keeps its own tabs, active tab and unsaved text, and switching
  swaps the workbench. Stored layouts migrate: whatever was open before the
  upgrade is adopted by the first connection you use.
- **Ctrl+W on a group with no tabs left closes the connection**, which is the
  only thing left in the workbench for "close" to act on once tabs belong to
  one — and the first keyboard route to closing a connection at all.
- **Update all** in the Installed extensions header, shown only when something
  is actually updatable, with one confirmation listing every version transition
  it will make. Updating used to mean finding each outdated row and clicking
  through its own dialog — a chore proportional to how long you had been away.
  A failure is reported by name and does not strand the updates queued behind
  it.

### Removed

- **The Lakehouse panel and the lakehouse connector catalog left the app**, to
  [irodori-lakehouse](https://github.com/irodori-table/irodori-lakehouse).
  #196 extracted Knowledge and Lakehouse from the standard product and #197
  packaged them as feature extensions gating panels that stayed compiled in, so
  "not shipped" meant "shipped, but switched off": 427 lines of panel, 25
  translation keys per locale and 240 lines of CSS in every build. Knowledge
  keeps that model; Lakehouse does not.

  *Impact:* the **Lakehouse** sidebar view is gone, and `irodori.datalake` no
  longer activates anything — an installed copy is ignored rather than
  re-enabling a view that does not exist. The six lakehouse connectors
  (`irodori.iceberg`, `irodori.delta-lake`, `irodori.hudi`, `irodori.hive`,
  `irodori.athena`, `irodori.s3-tables`) are no longer listed in this build's
  marketplace catalog.

  *Migration:* existing connections keep working. The engines are still
  recognised and still dispatch to the same connector extension ids, so an
  already-installed lakehouse connector connects exactly as before and
  **Connect** still names the extension it needs when one is missing — it now
  comes from the lakehouse registry rather than this one. DuckDB, MotherDuck,
  Databricks and Trino/Presto are unaffected and stay in this catalog.

### Changed

- Leaving SSL mode unset keeps the driver default, so every existing profile
  connects exactly as before. Only Neon, Redshift, and Supabase default to
  `require` — they cannot be run locally, so there is no plaintext case to
  preserve. Self-hostable engines are untouched.
- Unix-socket profiles never negotiate TLS: a socket is not a network hop, and
  servers that offer TLS only on the TCP listener reject it.
- **A left click in the connections rail always switches connection.** It used
  to open the Connection Manager whenever the profile happened to be closed, so
  "switch to staging" became "a settings dialog opened". A closed profile is
  opened instead; editing and closing moved to the right-click menu.
- **Every engine has an icon of its own.** DynamoDB rendered a generic `{ }`
  glyph, six engines shared one database icon and four shared a stack of
  layers — in the rail, where the icon is all there is, two different
  connections looked identical. Bigtable and Supabase gained real brand marks;
  the rest gained distinct glyphs. AWS and Oracle marks remain absent from the
  public-domain icon set, so those engines still get a neutral glyph rather
  than a look-alike.
- **Supabase is treated as the PostgreSQL it is** by the SQL snippets and
  keyword completion, which had both omitted it.
- **The connections rail lists open connections, not saved profiles.** Closing
  a connection looked like it had done nothing, because the icon that stayed
  behind was never the connection — it was the profile that could become one.
  Closing now removes it, and the button at the foot of the rail opens the
  Connection Manager, which is where saved profiles live and where new ones are
  added.
- **Errors and warnings dismiss themselves after ten seconds.** They used to
  stay until clicked, so a retrying connection stacked identical "Connect
  failed" cards over the workbench until each was cleared by hand.
- **An extension's enabled state is legible at a glance** — a badge with a
  status dot, and a coloured action beside it, rather than a grey word and a
  neutral button whose verb was the only clue.
- The selected item in a segmented control (Color mode, result filters, log
  filters) is a tinted fill instead of a solid saturated blue, which read as a
  heavy block rather than a selection in light themes.
- Sibling crates are consumed from the `irodori-table` organisation rather than
  the pre-transfer owner, at `irodori-kit` v0.7.9.

### Sibling and extension releases

- `irodori-kit` v0.7.6 through v0.7.9 — a connector authentication consistency
  check for the shared extension CI, and three fixes to reusable workflow
  references that had made extension releases impossible since the organisation
  move.
- `irodori-extension-dynamodb` v0.1.8 — two bugs that compounded into
  "DynamoDB Local never connects, and says something unreadable about it". The
  connector never read the custom endpoint: the manifest writes that field to
  `host`, which nothing in the driver looked at, so it silently talked to the
  public regional endpoint. Its error redaction then called `str::replace` with
  an empty needle whenever no endpoint was set, which inserts the placeholder
  between every character of the message. A bare loopback endpoint also keeps
  plain HTTP now, instead of being rewritten to `https://` and failing a TLS
  handshake against a server that speaks none.
- All 35 connector extensions released with authentication work: mutual TLS
  across ten connectors, AWS assume-role, object-store credentials through
  DuckDB secrets, MongoDB X.509/LDAP/OIDC, Google ADC and impersonation,
  Microsoft Entra tokens, OAuth2 client-credentials grants, and a MotherDuck
  connector that finally connects to MotherDuck rather than opening a local file
  named `md:…`.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-08-08

Release packaging fix with no application behavior changes.

### Fixed

- Direct `tauri-action` releases and local release commands now install the
  AppImage host-library exclusion shim in the same XDG cache that Tauri uses.
  The shim payload stays outside linuxdeploy's plugin-name pattern so plugin
  discovery cannot bypass it and bundle `libwayland-client.so.0`, which shadows
  the host compositor library. The dry run now rehearses the direct release
  path as well (#214).

## [0.8.9] - 2026-08-08

Release pipeline repair attempt. The GitHub Release was created, but the run
was canceled before package upload when the final consumer audit found that
the direct `tauri-action` path bypassed the local build wrapper.

### Changed

- Routed local Linux release commands through the repository-local AppImage
  tooling cache and kept the exclusion shim payload outside linuxdeploy's
  plugin-name pattern (#214).

## [0.8.8] - 2026-08-08

Dependency maintenance release with no intentional user-facing behavior
changes.

### Changed

- Updated the desktop npm tooling group, including Testing Library user-event
  14.6.3, oxfmt 0.62.0, and oxlint 1.77.0 (#211).
- Updated the shared foundation pins to Irodori Knowledge 0.3.2 and Irodori Kit
  0.7.5, keeping every direct workspace dependency and the Cargo lockfile on
  one source revision (#212).

### Security

- Updated the lockfile resolutions for DOMPurify 3.4.13, Mermaid 11.16.1, and
  nanoid 3.3.18 so the current npm advisory audit is clean (#211).

## [0.8.5] - 2026-07-30

Repository tooling release with no intentional user-facing application
changes.

### Changed

- Added repository-local Graphify guidance and integrations for Codex, Claude,
  and GitHub Copilot so each agent can query and refresh the project knowledge
  graph consistently.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-07-27

Dependency maintenance release with no intentional user-facing behavior
changes.

### Changed

- Updated the desktop npm dependency group, including Dockview 7.0.4, React
  19.2.8, Playwright 1.62.0, Testing Library jest-dom 7.0.0, and the current
  formatting and linting tools (#202).
- Updated the Rust dependency group, including base64 0.23.0, serde_json
  1.0.151, Tokio 1.53.1, tokio-util 0.7.19, typeship 0.2.1, and
  sql-dialect-fmt 1.18.0 (#203).
- Updated the OpenSSF Scorecard action from 2.4.3 to 2.4.4 (#201).

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-26

Repository maintenance only. The application is unchanged from 0.8.2 — the
packages for this tag are rebuilt from identical sources.

### Changed

- The before/after screenshots embedded in pull requests #155 and #156 now live
  in `docs/assets/pr/`. They were hosted on two branches that existed only to
  serve those images, which meant the branches could never be deleted without
  breaking the merged pull requests that linked them (#200).

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Log buffers support marking lines in four colours. Marks are listed above the
  buffer, jump to the line when clicked, and persist per file so reopening a log
  later keeps the trail. Marks past the end of a shortened file are dropped, so
  a truncated or rotated log cannot list lines that no longer exist (#177).

### Fixed

- The BI, Explain Plan and Lakehouse panels now render in the selected
  language. All three were English-only regardless of the language setting,
  including the plan analysis views, the plan node detail table, the lakehouse
  action list, and the BI field summaries (#170).
- Remaining tooltips and screen-reader labels across the colour picker, chart
  view, result graph, ERD, editor split, metadata tool window, completion
  inspector and AI provider forms now follow the language setting (#170).
- `tools/extensions/scaffold-connector-repos.mjs --force` no longer reverts
  implemented connector drivers to the bootstrap template. It regenerates
  manifests, docs, CI and packaging as before but preserves each repo's Rust
  sources; `--force-drivers` is the explicit opt-in for overwriting them (#182).
- The connector scaffold runs again at all. Since 0.8.0 added declarative
  feature extensions, which ship no driver and therefore declare no engine, the
  generator aborted with "irodori.knowledge has no engine" — even in
  `--dry-run` (#182).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Japanese users can now operate the Schema Designer, Schema Diagram, Import,
  and Search & Replace dialogs in Japanese. All four rendered entirely in
  English regardless of the language setting, action buttons included (#133).
- Git panel errors, the outcome chip on every query-history row, background job
  kinds and statuses, theme kind suffixes, and the import, ERD export, table
  specification, knowledge pack, and passkey error messages are translated
  instead of always English (#135).
- Five JSON parsers accepted an array where they required an object — their own
  error messages said "must be an object" — and then read string keys off it,
  yielding `undefined` for every field instead of a clear failure. Affects
  table-specification import, schema-diagram import, SQL keyword and snippet
  configuration, and passkey credential parsing (#167).
- Query-history retention limits set through Settings ▸ JSON are rounded to
  whole numbers, matching what the settings UI already did. A fractional value
  previously persisted as-is (#167).
- The run menu in the SQL editor no longer opens off the left edge of the
  window when the editor pane is narrow (#172).

### Changed

- Connecting with the Hive connector now raises a warning that stays until
  dismissed: it reads Parquet files under the table root and ignores the
  metastore, so partitions stored elsewhere and ORC/Avro/text tables read as
  empty or fail to resolve. Hudi and Delta Lake were corrected upstream and no
  longer warn (#117).
- Notifications gained a warning level for outcomes that succeeded but cannot be
  trusted. Like errors, warnings stay until dismissed rather than disappearing
  after a few seconds.
- The remove buttons in the Schema Designer's column, index, and foreign-key
  rows now have accessible names (#133).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Declarative feature extensions can activate named, trusted workbench features
  compiled into Irodori Table without executing downloaded code.
- The public Irodori Knowledge and Irodori Datalake extensions are available in
  the marketplace on Linux, macOS, and Windows for x86_64 and Arm64.

### Changed

- Knowledge and Lakehouse/Datalake panels and commands are available only while
  their matching extension is installed and enabled. Install them from
  **Settings ▸ Extensions**; disabling or uninstalling one removes its UI
  immediately. Existing native connector extensions remain compatible.

### Security

- Declarative packages use the same pinned-release download, SHA-256 integrity,
  exact-permission, safe-path, and manifest validation as native extensions.

## [0.7.47] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- The connection manager moves bulk deletion into row context menus, removes
  the redundant Disconnect and Profile ID controls, and simplifies export
  password notices.
- The Lakehouse sidebar entry stays hidden until its datalake workflows are
  production-ready.

### Fixed

- The workbench dock divider now uses the light Irodori theme instead of the
  dark Dockview fallback.
- Deleting the final saved connection leaves the list empty instead of
  recreating a placeholder profile.
- Knowledge pack update timestamps render as local calendar dates.

## [0.7.46] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Log files gain level and text filtering: pick a minimum severity and/or type
  a pattern, and non-matching entries fold away without touching the document.
  Stack-trace lines follow their parent entry, so a filtered ERROR keeps its
  trace. Filters are per-tab and reset when the tab changes language.
- The Iceberg connection form exposes the OAuth2 catalog fields
  (server URI, client ID, scope); the client secret travels in the
  session-only credential field and is never persisted in options.

### Fixed

- Opening the terminal without the desktop runtime no longer crashes the whole
  workbench; it shows a clear notice instead, and the panel is isolated behind
  an error boundary.
- A panic during an AI chat no longer permanently breaks every subsequent chat
  command, and cancelling a chat during such a failure actually cancels the
  running query instead of silently doing nothing.
- The extension installer honours a catalog entry's manifest path and rejects
  unsupported install kinds up front instead of mishandling them as GitHub
  releases.
- BigQuery and Bigtable share one GCP token implementation instead of two
  divergent copies.

## [0.7.45] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Dependency updates: the Rust group (8 crates), the desktop npm group
  (6 packages), and the GitHub Actions group (2 actions).

### Added

- Regression tests pinning the Japanese settings translations — the
  repository's first external contribution (thanks @MFA-G, #151).

## [0.7.44] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- CSV, TSV, and log files are syntax-highlighted in the editor: rainbow
  columns with a distinct header row for delimited files (quote-aware, so
  embedded delimiters parse correctly), and severity/timestamp/section
  highlighting for logs, all in theme colours. Non-SQL buffers drop SQL
  completion, linting, and formatting.
- Import can append to an existing table instead of always creating a new one.
- The extension marketplace hides entries that cannot be installed on the
  current platform, with a note to reveal them.

### Fixed

- Terminal tabs are reachable by keyboard and announced as real tabs; the
  panel's strings are translated.
- External links in settings open through the system opener, so they work in
  the packaged app.
- The AI settings no longer render glued text ("withclaude / codexfrom a
  terminal"), and the local-model install hint only shows for providers that
  install local models.
- Dates and numbers follow the app language in the remaining places that used
  the OS locale.
- The stale "held in memory only" description of AI provider keys now says
  they are saved to the OS keychain, matching what the app does.
- Internal cleanup: dead menu config and unreachable strings removed, platform
  detection modernised, duplicated primitives consolidated.

## [0.7.43] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- The schema diagram's "Create DB SQL" emits indexes again; they were silently
  dropped from the generated script while the equivalent table-spec path kept
  them.
- Local branches containing a slash (feature/login) are no longer classified as
  remote: they stay visible with "Show remote branches" unchecked, filter as
  branches, and lose the remote badge styling.
- The primary-key checkbox in the schema designer's Alter mode is disabled with
  an explanation instead of silently doing nothing.
- Commit dates in the Git graph and query history show the year for entries
  from previous years, and follow the app language instead of the OS locale.
- CSV import keeps leading zeros: zero-padded values such as postal codes are
  typed as text instead of being coerced to integers.

### Accessibility

- The settings JSON editor, snippet import box, connection search, Git branch
  controls, and both connection-form toggles have real accessible names; the
  editor tab list no longer announces the new-tab and menu buttons as tabs.
- The connection dialog's Delete button is disabled when there is nothing to
  delete, and a first run shows "No saved connections yet" instead of "No
  matching connections".

## [0.7.42] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Replace All no longer corrupts documents: an out-of-range `$n` group
  reference spliced the entire buffer into every match, across every open tab.
- Backend errors show their real message instead of `[object Object]` —
  extension installs, plan explanations, row-detail queries, migration studio,
  snippets import, security settings, schema diagram, and knowledge refresh
  were all affected.
- Query history records again on fresh profiles, and the result memory budget
  starts at its intended 10,000 rows instead of 1,000. Both were the same
  absent-key-read-as-zero defect, now fixed once in a shared parser.
- Primary buttons are readable in every dark theme; contrast was as low as
  1.5:1. The light default's line-number gutter also now meets WCAG AA.
- The Run options menu, the editor tab "..." menu, and the Lakehouse context
  menu render on screen; each was clipped or displaced by a dock container.
- Copy as Excel copies the HTML table instead of an empty string.
- Closing one sidebar no longer resizes the other or loses its stored width.
- The Git panel loads when opened from the sidebar tab, and its repository
  path controls stay visible when no repository has resolved.
- The Structure view renders its separators instead of literal `\u00b7` text.
- The editor context menu is translated (15 of 16 items stayed English).

### Changed

- New default themes, Irodori Bloom and Bloom Paper, built from the app icon's
  palette with a real accent hue and verified WCAG AA contrast.
- One typographic scale anchored on the menu bar size; 182 hardcoded font
  sizes migrated to tokens.
- Sidebar view tabs default to icons only on a single row; text labels are a
  new setting under Settings > General.
- The transport toggle renders as a proper segmented control with a visible
  active state.
- Editor tabs keep a readable minimum width and scroll instead of shrinking to
  one character; the new-tab and tab-actions buttons gained separation and a
  larger hit target.
- The settings dialog is wider, and narrowed sidebars collapse to a compact
  state instead of hiding their content.

### Added

- Lakehouse connections are configured in the connection form: catalog,
  warehouse, region, and credential fields per engine.
- View tabs can be dragged between the left and right sidebars.
- SQL snippets are searchable and taggable, and collapse to summaries.
- Keyboard shortcuts are visibly editable in the keymap settings.
- Settings > General > Reset layout restores the default panel arrangement.
- A user guide in docs/ covering every feature area, with a lakehouse
  zero-to-connection walkthrough and Git panel setup.
- Japanese translations for the connection form (86 field labels) and other
  previously untranslated surfaces.

## [0.7.41] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Release infrastructure only; the application is unchanged from 0.7.40. The
  cache-warming workflow failed on Windows on every run since it was added, so
  Windows release builds recompiled their dependencies from cold each time and
  a partial cache entry kept the correct one from ever being saved.

## [0.7.40] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- TLS now runs on a single crypto backend. The desktop build previously
  compiled both `aws-lc-rs` and `ring`; it now uses `ring` alone, which the
  updater already required. Certificate verification is unchanged and still
  uses the operating system trust store. Connections lose the post-quantum
  hybrid X25519MLKEM768 key exchange and fall back to classical key exchange.
- Foundation crates move to irodori-kit v0.7.0, which also carries the 0BSD
  license metadata repair, cross-platform extension release automation, and the
  Windows extension packaging fix.

### Added

- A Nix dev shell (`flake.nix`) pinning the exact Rust from
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, Node 24, mold, and the Linux desktop libraries, so a
  local checkout gets the same toolchain CI uses.

## [0.7.39] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- Stable releases no longer require platform signing credentials. Each signing
  lane detects its own secrets and turns itself off when they are absent, so a
  stable release publishes the full Linux, universal macOS, and Windows set —
  unsigned — instead of failing the dispatch. Release notes state which
  artifacts are unsigned, and unsigned macOS and Windows packages may trigger
  Gatekeeper and SmartScreen warnings.
- Updater artifacts are no longer exclusive to fully signed builds. They are
  published whenever the updater signing keys are configured, independent of
  Apple and Windows code signing, so the stable auto-update channel works for
  unsigned releases. Releases without updater keys omit `latest.json` and must
  be upgraded by reinstalling.

## [0.7.38] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- The sidebar object browser names lakehouse containers per each engine's
  source-type contract: namespaces for DuckDB, MotherDuck, Iceberg, S3 Tables,
  Delta Lake, and Hudi; databases for Hive and Athena. Lakehouse containers
  render a dedicated icon distinct from schema folders.

## [0.7.37] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Unsigned desktop builds no longer register the updater plugin without its
  signed-release configuration, preventing an updater configuration panic from
  aborting startup.

### Changed

- Lightweight releases now publish Linux AppImage, deb, and rpm packages. The
  preview channel appends unsigned universal macOS app/dmg packages and
  supports SignPath-signed Windows NSIS/MSI installers for a complete
  pre-release asset set.

## [0.7.34] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Updated `crossbeam-epoch` to 0.9.20 for the RustSec advisory fix.
- Updated GitHub Actions cache usage to the current major across CI, security,
  and release workflows.

## [0.7.33] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Updated the desktop npm dependency group and Rust dependency group from
  Dependabot. (#77, #78)

## [0.7.32] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Sidebars keep their configured widths (explorer 200px, inspector 300px by
  default) when the dock layout is first built or a sidebar is opened;
  dockview's proportional redistribution stretched the explorer to ~465px on
  a 1440px window. (#74)

## [0.7.31] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- The results header wraps inside a narrowed pane instead of overflowing:
  result-set tabs and actions were sliced at the sidebar boundary, which read
  as the sidebar overlaying the results. (#72)

## [0.7.30] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Row Detail moved out of the results pane into a full-height right sidebar
  view (VS Code-style): selecting a row or cell opens it, the sidebar view
  switcher can bring it back, and closing it clears the row selection. (#68)
- The Save button is removed from the editor run toolbar; saving stays on
  File → Save and its keyboard shortcut, keeping the bottom dock focused on
  format/run actions. (#70)

## [0.7.29] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Stable release dispatch now gates on updater, Windows signing, and macOS
  signing/notarization secrets before publishing signed Windows artifacts,
  signed/notarized macOS artifacts, and stable updater manifests.
- Editor Save/Run toolbar is docked at the bottom-right of the editor pane,
  with the run-options dropdown opening upward (TablePlus-style). (#64)
- Saved connections moved from the explorer panel strip to a dedicated
  far-left connections rail with engine icons and color tags (TablePlus-style).
  (#65)
- Left/right sidebars span the full workspace height; the saved dockview
  layout key is bumped to v2 so existing installs pick up the new arrangement
  (VS Code-style). (#66)
- Editor tabs use the WAI-ARIA tablist pattern and gain hover close buttons,
  middle-click close, and a visible tab-actions menu. (#62)
- Menubar supports WAI-ARIA APG keyboard navigation. (#55)

### Fixed

- Body-portaled popovers (menubar menus, context menus) rendered fully
  transparent; theme variables are now mirrored onto `:root`. (#52)
- Escape closed every stacked dialog at once; it now closes only the topmost.
  (#53)
- Settings dialog lacked initial focus, a focus trap, and `aria-modal`. (#54)
- Unsaved SQL tab content was silently lost on quit/reload; editor tabs are
  now persisted. (#56)
- Discard wiped staged grid edits without confirmation, and the delete-rows
  confirm button was mislabeled "Commit". (#57)
- Large UI surfaces (Connection Manager, ERD, About, run controls, query
  parameters, sidebar, titlebar/statusbar, results summary) bypassed i18n and
  showed English under the Japanese locale; 141 keys added to both locales.
  (#58)
- Every "接続を追加" click persisted a fresh "Connection N" draft; pristine
  drafts are now reused and discarded on close, and the SQLite sample profile
  is only persisted after a successful connection. (#59)
- Toast stack covered dialog action buttons (Connect/Test/Save in the
  Connection Manager). (#60)
- ERD showed "no tables match" while metadata was still loading, and
  lazy-loaded dialogs opened with no feedback. (#61)
- Result-mode control state was not announced to assistive technology, and
  the About copy-path button failed silently and could get stuck. (#63)

## [0.7.6] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- DuckDB and MotherDuck now ship through installable connector extensions; the
  desktop crate no longer carries embedded libduckdb or a `duckdb` Cargo
  feature.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Lightweight Linux releases now skip duplicate release-job typegen checks and
  publish an AppImage-only artifact so the fast lane spends less time compiling
  and packaging.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Lightweight Linux releases now build default features only, leaving DuckDB and
  legacy connector bundles out of the fast release lane.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- The tag release workflow now publishes a lightweight Linux pre-release without
  macOS, Windows, or updater signing so releases can proceed while signing
  secrets are being provisioned.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- Migration Studio now delegates plan generation to `irodori-migration` 0.4
  through a typed Tauri command, removing the incompatible TypeScript BLAKE3
  planner and using the crate's cross-engine MD5 row-hash contract.
- The migration planner boundary now has generated TypeScript bindings, native
  regression tests, and UI bridge tests for the desktop command contract.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Release builds now pass `--features legacy-connectors,duckdb` so packaged
  binaries include the built-in connectors documented as shipped.
- The release dry-run workflow uses the same connector feature set as the
  release workflow.
- Feature-gated connector errors now point users toward release builds or
  marketplace connectors instead of only telling developers to rebuild locally.

### Changed

- TypeScript binding generation dependencies were updated to `typeship` 0.2.0.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Native connector extension framework groundwork, connector repository
  scaffolding updates, and extension scenario/fleet tooling.
- Release hardening for public desktop distribution: Windows code signing,
  macOS signing/notarization preparation, signed Tauri updater artifacts, and
  stable-channel `latest.json` publication.
- Knowledge ML cheatsheet extraction hardening and developer doctor checks for
  release/environment readiness.

### Changed

- Desktop app structure was reorganized around controller hooks and clearer
  workbench boundaries.
- Release documentation now records signing secrets, notarization setup,
  updater channel policy, and breaking-change policy.
- Connector catalog and support snapshots were aligned with the managed
  extension distribution model.

### Removed

- Legacy generic `objectStore` and `kvStore` engine exposure was removed from
  the root catalog and app-consumed docs/snapshots.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- First-run onboarding: the empty object browser now offers "Open SQLite
  sample" (creates an in-memory sample database with demo tables) and
  "Add a connection"; a connected-but-empty database offers "Create a table"
  and "Import from file".
- Retry button on connection and query error notifications when the backend
  classifies the error as retryable.
- Notifications now stack (up to 4) instead of overwriting each other;
  error notifications stay until dismissed.
- Command palette: arrow-key navigation, focus trap, and combobox ARIA.
- Object browser tree: keyboard navigation (Up/Down/Left/Right/Home/End).
- About dialog links to documentation, GitHub, and the issue tracker.
- Notification, sidebar, and onboarding strings are localized (English and
  Japanese).

- Clicking a line number selects that line (Shift+click extends), plus a
  Mod+L select-line shortcut.
- Editor accuracy and performance regression suite (e2e): exact-text edit
  scenarios plus 5,000-line load/typing/scroll benchmarks with a gutter
  alignment check.

### Fixed

- Desktop exports (results, ERD SVG/PNG, table specs, connection profiles,
  SQL tabs, schema diagrams) use the native Save As dialog instead of a
  browser download, which exposed the dev-server address in the WebKitGTK
  download banner.
- The editor re-measures font metrics on UI zoom changes and after async
  font loads, and the code font is integer-px — the caret no longer drifts
  off the character it edits.
- Editor gutter pins the content font metrics so line numbers stay aligned
  with their lines in the WebKitGTK webview.

### Changed

- All destructive-action confirmations use the styled confirm dialog
  (git operations, history bulk delete, local AI model delete, reload guard)
  instead of native `window.confirm`.
- Committing grid edits that include row deletions now asks for a final
  confirmation.
- SECURITY.md documents GitHub private vulnerability reporting as the
  disclosure channel.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-01

- Foundation crates extracted to the sibling repo
  [irodori-kit](https://github.com/irodori-table/irodori-kit) (consumed via git
  tags); this repository is app-only.
- Packaging templates moved to irodori-kit.
- Bundled sample connections and the seeded demo workspace were removed;
  a fresh install starts with an empty workspace.
