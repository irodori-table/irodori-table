# Data Source Support Status

Last generated: 2026-06-26 JST (hand-authored seed; target is auto-generation —
see <https://irodori-table.github.io/irodori-docs/knowledge-base.html>).

This is the single inventory of **what Irodori connects to today vs. what is
declared, planned, or not yet started**. The authoritative source of truth is the
`DbEngine` registry in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/db/engine.rs` and the connect
dispatch in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/db.rs`. Roadmap intent lives in
<https://irodori-table.github.io/irodori-docs/data-source-coverage-strategy.html>;
this file reconciles intent against the code.

For contract/provisioning and managed-service verification procedures, see
<https://irodori-table.github.io/irodori-docs/external-db-contract-and-verification.html>.

Status legend:

- **Wired** — has a production connect path and a dedicated adapter or a
  wire-compatible adapter it routes through.
- **Verified** — Wired *and* exercised against a real instance in
  `tests/integration_db.rs` through the sample harness (`task db-verify`).
- **Pending** — recognized by the engine enum, adapter scaffolding exists, but the
  connector intentionally returns a "not ready" result.
- **Extension** — recognized by the engine enum and published through the
  extension marketplace; the app browses `registry/catalog/catalog.json`
  and install/details stay in `registry/catalog/index.json` instead of
  being compiled into the core desktop build.
- **Recognized, extension required** — present in `DbEngine` but rejected at
  connect by `is_unimplemented_wire()` until an installable connector extension
  is present.
- **Not registered** — named in the roadmap/coverage strategy but **absent from the
  `DbEngine` enum** — i.e. not selectable in the app at all yet.

> Maturity is a coverage signal, not a UX guarantee. "Wired (adapter)" means the

> explain/profile, and visualization per source remain tracked by SRC tickets.
> DuckDB and MotherDuck ship through marketplace connector extensions instead of

> optional legacy connectors for speed. When a custom build omits an optional
> connector, the app reports that the selected data source is unavailable in this

## 2. Pending (recognized, scaffolded, returns "not ready")

None today. If an adapter has a dedicated `Wire` but intentionally returns a
not-ready error, list it here instead of mixing it with production connectors.

## 3. Marketplace / extension-required engines

These appear in `DbEngine`, but the core desktop build has no embedded driver for
them. The app asks the user to install the matching connector from
`registry/catalog/index.json` before a connection can be opened.

| Engine | `DbEngine` id | Family | Closest existing wire | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DuckDB | `duckdb` | Analytical | `DuckDb` | Installable connector; owns local file and in-memory workflows without compiling libduckdb into the app. |
| MotherDuck | `motherduck` | Analytical / lakehouse | `DuckDb` | Installable connector; owns DuckDB/MotherDuck service workflows. |
| Memgraph | `memgraph` | Graph (Bolt/Cypher) | `Neo4j` | Installable connector; can reuse the Neo4j/Bolt path internally. |
| Qdrant | `qdrant` | Vector | — | Installable vector connector extension. |
| Milvus | `milvus` | Vector | — | Installable vector connector extension. |
| Pinecone | `pinecone` | Vector (HTTP) | — | Installable vector connector extension. |
| Cloud Spanner | `cloudSpanner` | Distributed SQL / Google API | `CloudSpanner` | Installable connector; Spanner SQL/catalog handling is separate from Postgres wire. |
| Trino / Presto | `trinoPresto` | Federated SQL | `Jdbc` | Installable JDBC-style connector extension. |
| Firebird | `firebird` | Relational | `Jdbc` | Installable JDBC-style connector extension. |
| Databricks / Spark SQL | `databricks` | Warehouse | `Jdbc` | Installable SQL Warehouse connector extension. |
| Elasticsearch | `elasticsearch` | Search | `Search` | Installable search connector extension with index/data-stream workflows. |
| OpenSearch | `openSearch` | Search | `Search` | Installable search connector extension with index/data-stream workflows. |
| Couchbase | `couchbase` | Document | `Document` | Installable document connector extension. |
| DynamoDB | `dynamodb` | Key-value | `KeyValue` | Installable key-value connector extension. |
| ArangoDB | `arangodb` | Graph / multi-model | `Graph` | Installable graph/multi-model connector extension. |
| Apache IoTDB | `iotdb` | Time-series | `TimeSeries` | Installable time-series connector extension. |
| Apache Hive | `hive` | Lakehouse / catalog | `Jdbc` | Installable Hive/Hive Metastore connector extension. **Known limitation (#117): reduces every table to a bare `read_parquet` glob under the table root, ignoring the metastore — partitions stored elsewhere, and ORC/Avro/text tables, read as empty or fail to resolve. The app warns on connect.** |
| Amazon Athena | `athena` | Lakehouse / query-engine | `Lakehouse` | Installable Athena/Glue/workgroup connector extension. |
| Apache Iceberg | `iceberg` | Lakehouse | `Lakehouse` | Installable catalog-backed Iceberg connector extension. |
| AWS S3 Tables | `s3Tables` | Lakehouse | `Lakehouse` | Installable managed Iceberg connector extension. |
| Delta Lake | `deltaLake` | Lakehouse | `Lakehouse` | Installable Delta Lake connector extension. |
| Apache Hudi | `hudi` | Lakehouse | `Lakehouse` | Installable Hudi connector extension. |

## 4. Not registered (roadmap intent, not in the engine enum yet)

Named in the public data-source coverage strategy / feature matrix but
**not selectable in the app** — adding any of these starts with a new `DbEngine`
variant + `Wire` + adapter.

All roadmap sources currently promoted into the registry are listed above. Keep this section for future coverage-strategy ideas that are not selectable in the app yet.

## 4b. Transport security (sqlx-backed engines)

The Postgres- and MySQL-wire engines take TLS settings from the connection form
and pass them to sqlx as URL parameters (`db/engine.rs` `SslSettings`):

| Form field | Postgres parameter | MySQL parameter |
|---|---|---|
| SSL mode | `sslmode` | `ssl-mode` |
| SSL root certificate | `sslrootcert` | `ssl-ca` |
| SSL client certificate | `sslcert` | `ssl-cert` |
| SSL client key | `sslkey` | `ssl-key` |

The app speaks the PostgreSQL vocabulary (`disable`, `allow`, `prefer`,
`require`, `verify-ca`, `verify-full`) and translates for MySQL, which has no
`allow` and spells the strongest mode `verify_identity`.

Leaving SSL mode unset keeps sqlx's own default — `prefer` / `preferred`, which
attempts TLS, **falls back to plaintext without complaint**, and verifies no
certificate. That is why **Neon** and **Redshift** default to `require`: they
cannot be run locally, so there is no plaintext case to preserve. Every
self-hostable engine keeps the driver default, because `irodori-samples` runs
them insecure and raising the floor would break `task db-verify`. Unix-socket
profiles never negotiate TLS.

### Supabase endpoints

A Supabase project exposes three endpoints and the port is what tells them
apart:

| Endpoint | Host | Port | User | Prepared statements |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Direct | `db.<ref>.supabase.co` | 5432 | `postgres` | yes |
| Supavisor session | `aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com` | 5432 | `postgres.<ref>` | yes |
| Supavisor transaction | `aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com` | 6543 | `postgres.<ref>` | **no** |

Transaction mode multiplexes one server connection across clients, so a named
prepared statement is gone by the next round trip and sqlx's default statement
cache turns the *second* query into `prepared statement "sqlx_s_1" already
exists`. Port 6543 therefore appends `statement-cache-capacity=0`
automatically; the `poolMode` connector option overrides the inference for
self-hosted Supavisor deployments on other ports.

Only these two wires are covered. The dedicated connectors (SQL Server, Oracle,
MongoDB, ClickHouse, …) and every extension-backed engine still have no TLS
surface — see irodori-table#232.

## 5. Managed wire-compatible targets

These should not become separate `DbEngine` variants unless they need native API
surface beyond connection templates. They route through existing adapters:

| Target | Route through | Status | Product work |
|---|---|---|---|
| Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL | `postgres` | Covered by Postgres wire; needs preset/docs | Writer/reader/custom endpoint hints, IAM auth, cluster topology. |
| Amazon Aurora MySQL | `mysql` | Covered by MySQL wire; needs preset/docs | Writer/reader/custom endpoint hints, IAM auth, cluster topology. |
| Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL | `postgres` | Covered by Postgres wire; needs preset/docs | Public/private IP, Auth Proxy, IAM DB auth, SSL cert handling. |
| Google Cloud SQL for MySQL | `mysql` | Covered by MySQL wire; needs preset/docs | Public/private IP, Auth Proxy, IAM DB auth, SSL cert handling. |
| Google Cloud SQL for SQL Server | `sqlserver` | Covered by TDS path; needs preset/docs | Public/private IP, Auth Proxy, SQL Server connection-string guidance. |

## 6. Gaps worth deciding on

- **Vector DBs are extension-first.** Qdrant/Milvus/Pinecone are registry entries
  with marketplace extensions. Their shared `vector` source-type contract is
  projected into the catalog for collection/index browsing, vector metadata,
  similarity search, filtered/hybrid search, and vector-neighbor result views.
- **Memgraph is extension-first.** It speaks Bolt/Cypher like Neo4j; the extension
  can reuse the Neo4j path internally before core promotes it to a wired adapter.
- **ScyllaDB** now rides the existing `cassandra.rs` CQL path; the remaining work is verification against a real ScyllaDB instance and source-specific UX polish.
- **Iceberg/lakehouse** is now extension-first: Apache Iceberg, S3 Tables, Delta
  Lake, Hudi, Hive, Athena, MotherDuck, DuckDB, and Databricks all have
  marketplace connectors or recognized entries. Their shared `lakehouse`
  source-type contract is projected into the catalog for catalog/namespace/table
  browsing, table-format metadata, execution-backend selection, catalog
  credentials, and starter query templates.

When section 1–4 membership changes, it should be regenerated from the registry,
not hand-edited — see
